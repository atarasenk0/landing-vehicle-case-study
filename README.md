# Overview

## Purpose
This readme is designed to keep a log of my progress as I work through the real time embedded software case study. 

## Problem Overview
- see case study document...

## Problem Breakdown
- Identify/generate a potential state space model to model the Swoop Aero vehicle
- Generate test-data  to simulate the vehicle in cartesian coordinates during each landing phase
- Implement a visualiser in order to visualise the above [x,y,z] vehicle information
- Implement KF to estimate height of the vehicle relative to ground
	- May be able to get away with a linear KF since each of the landing phases is linear... ?
- Extend the model by addressing "bonus points" requirements
	- This seems to be an extension of the KF model to be non-linear domain... Possibly EKF?

Can visualise the problem by considering the following diagram from [3].
- This case study considers the model in the blue box. 
- Inputs to the model are the values from the vision system (i.e. lidar). 
- The output of the model will be vehicle's pose estimation / position in the cartesian grid...

## Design Considerations

### Assumptions
- The problem solution will not consider control of the aircraft. Closed loop control of the aircraft is implied via the landing profile.
- Solution to the first part of the case study involves a linear kalman filter for estimation of the aircraft height above ground. 
- Solution to the second part of the case study involves a non-linear kalman filter for estimation of the aircraft height above ground. 
- Due to absence of vehicle characteristics, information required for simulation/KF implementation will be derived from existing literature. 
- In the interest of time, third party C++ libraries may be utilised for non-core aspects of the case study i.e. matrix algebra (e.g. Eigen Library), plotting (e.g. GNUPlot Library).
- SI units will be utilised throughout the case study
- Measurement/clock cycle for the vehicle is assumed to be 100ms for ease of computation. This sampling rate may not be representative of the actual vehicle.

### Constraints
- C++ compiler will be either GCC/Clang -- tested on MacOS Big Sur (v11.6.8)
- The simulation data (e.g. duration of each landing phase) may be adjusted from within the simulation class.
- For ease of computation, the landing sequence can complete within 30min.
